PSA: This project is so deeply WIP that it shouldn't count as existing. 
I only just discovered github's codespace and haven't coded anything in like 3 years...
Working on this project on a laptop I can't test with 99% of the time.
IE: This is gonna be rough for awhile.

Project Domain:
Yes: Personal Conlang Assistant Application for a Specific Language I'm currently building.
Possible, Maybe: Template for Dynamic Conlang?

Project Goals (ETA):
Step One: Functional random word generator based on hard coded rules. (Soonish? Maybe a week?)
Step Two: Implementation of smarter word rule system. (Possibly never, might be a pipe dream!)

Step X: Add Dictionary?? (sometime after I decide whether to write off step two)
Step Y: Add Grammar rules?? (Sometime after I figure out how to implement this...)
Step Z: 2-way Translator for this conlang?????????? (Sometime after X and Y? Maybe?)
