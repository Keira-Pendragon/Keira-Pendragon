PSA: This project is so deeply WIP that it shouldn't count as existing. 
I only just discovered github's codespace and haven't coded anything in like 3 years...
Working on this project on a laptop I can't test with 99% of the time.
IE: This is gonna be rough for awhile.

Project Domain:
Yes: Personal Conlang Assistant Application for a Specific Language I'm currently building.
Possible, Maybe: Template for Dynamic Conlang?

Project Goals (ETA):
Step One: Functional random word generator based on hard coded rules. (Soonish? Maybe a week?)
Step Two: Implementation of smarter word rule system. (Possibly never, might be a pipe dream!)

Step X: Add Dictionary?? (sometime after I decide whether to write off step two)
Step Y: Add Grammar rules?? (Sometime after I figure out how to implement this...)
Step Z: 2-way Translator for this conlang?????????? (Sometime after X and Y? Maybe?)

PS: I don't care what you do with this code - it's not even good rn, so I mean, really.
Just don't copy all my work and then say it's yours, and then sue me and tell me I can't keep
puttering away at it cause that'd be very uncool. Like, frrl, at least hire me and let me 
keep working on it, I miss working in software.... 

Oh, and yes. Keira Pendragon is my real name, and I am interested in a software or firmware job.
