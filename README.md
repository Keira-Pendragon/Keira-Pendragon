- 👋 Hi, I’m @Keira-Pendragon. Pronouns: she/her, them/they. I'm a cosmic rainbow kitty-dragon with an insatiable appetite for knowledge and new experiences. Neurodivergent and hyperanalytical, I thrive on understanding the world around me.
       
- 👀 Interests: Software, science, engineering, and technology captivate me. I'm equally passionate about VR, AI, and 3D printing. When I'm not geeking out over tech, I'm immersed in video games, tabletop RPGs, and storytelling. Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of Conlang.
      
- 🌱 Learning: I'm exploring codespaces to work on my portfolio and my Conlang project. Always on the lookout for new things to learn, especially if they can be tackled via codespaces.
       
- 💞️ Collaboration: Open to projects that align with my interests and values. Particularly keen on community-centric initiatives that aim to make the world a better place.
