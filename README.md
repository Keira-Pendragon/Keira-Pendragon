- 👋 Hi, I’m @Keira-Pendragon
       My pronouns are she/her, them/they etc... but never he/him. 
       I am an eclectic cosmic rainbow kitty-dragon who has the attention span of a chipmunk and an insatiable apetite for new experiences and knowledge...
       ... and utterly devoid of the health, energy and skeletal-muscular structural integrity to persue much of any of it except through the vicarious 
       and the virtual.
       
- 👀 I’m interested in anything software, especially projects that are helpful or entertaining for others.
      I am both fascinated by, and a little terrified of, the potential of VR, AI and 3D printing technology.
      Science, engineering and technology always catch my attention. Meanwhile video games and modern graphics capabilities are something of an obsession.
      My favorite passtimes outside of the above are; video games, tabletop roleplaying games, and anything to do with experiencing new stories.
      Currently extremely interested in Conlang - crafting my own for a story/game world. 
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - About how to use codespaces because being able to work on my portfolio while I'm otherwise twiddling my thumbs
       at work is gonna Rock. Currently employing this endevor in some double duty by using it to also work on my current conlang project. 
       So much to do, so little time - pro-tip trying to critically analyze and understand phonetics is a reliable way to give one's self a headache!
       
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Conlang related things maybe? Really anything where I can use codespaces to work on it and enable
      me to participate reliably and I can actively be helpful and better yet, learning new things!
