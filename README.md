- 👋 Hi, I’m @Keira-Pendragon
       My pronouns are she/her, them/they etc... but never he/him. 
       I am an eclectic cosmic rainbow kitty-dragon who has the attention span of a chipmunk and an insatiable apetite for new experiences and knowledge...
       ... and utterly devoid of the health, energy and skeletal-muscular structural integrity to persue much of any of it except through the vicarious 
       and the virtual. Life-long learner, Neurodivergent, hyperanalytical and excessively self-aware. I seek ever better understanding of all things.
       I like - nay - Need to understand the reasons, methods and outcomes of everything I can. Partly because understanding improves my ability to 
       navigate the world, partly because understanding improves my ability to empathize, but also, simply because it sates my endless curiosity.
       To me - knowledge and understanding is the purpose of existence. 
       (Having meaningful connections and life with lots of positive experiences is also integral - if nothing else, as a part of that purpose.)
       
- 👀 I’m interested in anything software, especially projects that are helpful or entertaining for others.
      I am both fascinated by, and a little terrified of, the potential of VR, AI and 3D printing technology.
      Science, engineering and technology always catch my attention. Meanwhile video games and modern graphics capabilities are something of an obsession.
      My favorite passtimes outside of the above are; video games, tabletop roleplaying games, and anything to do with experiencing new stories.
      Currently extremely interested in Conlang - crafting my own for a story/game world. 
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - About how to use codespaces because being able to work on my portfolio while I'm otherwise twiddling my thumbs
       at work is gonna Rock. Currently employing this endevor in some double duty by using it to also work on my current conlang project. 
       So much to do, so little time - pro-tip trying to critically analyze and understand phonetics is a reliable way to give one's self a headache!
       
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Conlang related things maybe? Really anything where I can use codespaces to work on it and enable
      me to participate reliably and I can actively be helpful and better yet, learning new things! (Also fixing the whole problem of human 
      civilizations having collectively been co-opted as purposless and self-destructive line go up machines rather than meaningful collaborations of humans 
      working together to make a better life for ourselves and each other. Currently promoting lots of community-centric things like gardens, infrastructure
      and housing, also the emailing of media outlets to shame them for helping prop up big oil and other stupid shit.)
