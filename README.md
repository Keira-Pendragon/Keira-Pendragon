- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Keira-Pendragon
       My pronouns are she/her, them/they etc... but never he/him. 
       I am an eclectic cosmic rainbow kitty-dragon who has the attention span of a chipmunk, the food adventerousness of Mikey*,
         and a stomach that makes that princess in the story with the pea seem not entirely wimpy.
       like, what even am I? ... Ah, right. I'm ADHD given form, with some fantasy and sci-fi thrown in for flavor.
       
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in anything software, especially projects that are helpful or entertaining for others.
      I am both fascinated by, and a little terrified of, the potential of VR, AI and 3D printing technology.
      Science, engineering and technology always catch my attention. Meanwhile video games and modern graphics capabilities are something of an obsession.
      My favorite passtimes outside of the above are; video games, tabletop roleplaying games, and anything to do with experiencing new stories.
      
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning - ...not a lot because of my current work hours, but I was learning android and unreal engine before I got derailed
                                          with plans to get back into it when I ever have a chance. Though I try to squeeze some in when I can brainz at all.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... I'll get back to this one when my schedule lets me breathe again for 2 minutes. 
            You might notice a complete lack of any projects here, I graduated from a college that had no business having a CS degree because they had no idea 
            what the real world job market was like in this era, whatsoever, and so I have like, nothing I am currently willing to showcase here. I want to fix
            that issue, but this is legitimately all I can manage 99% of the time. My current job is not conducive of existing beyond shoveling food in my face 
            and drooling on a keyboard after yet another 12 hour shift of silent empty and existential anxiety. It's exciting. Someone want to help me get started 
            building the AI to replace management here? Pretty sure replika could do better than these people if given math and scheduling data to train on.... 
            (No I'm not in a software job, Nowheresville, OR doesn't have much use for a junior software dev with only one year of firmware experience.)


- üì´ How to reach me ... no reaching me for now. Tooooo tired, and besides. I'm still boring right now lol.
              Though I guess if you really wanna... keira.nirvanna@gmail.com works I guess.
              If you happen to be a potential employer interested in a pity hire:
              I love everything about software development from refactoring and debugging old code
              to simple things like converting inputs from sensors like scales, diagnostic tools for 
              both hardware and software colleagues, builing UIs, or solving novel problems. 
              I'm most familiar with C/C++ and Java, but I've worked with Python, JSON, XML and a range of others...
              ...And I pick things up quickly, possibly too quickly... 
              
              PS) Pic is not me - she's art someone else made that is serving as my RP character currently~


- * You know, from those 90s commercials? Are those still around??
